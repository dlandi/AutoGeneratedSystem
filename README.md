# AutoGeneratedSystem
A sample app using C# Incremental Source Generators
C# Source Generatos allow you to inspect and enrich your code while compiling.
In this specific sample, we are using Incremental Generators to generate the code for Services, API Endpoints, and API Clients.
You will see some partial classes decorated with attributes such as
* `[ServiceOfEntity("{entityName}")]`
* `[ControllerOfEntity("{entityName}")]`
* `[ClientServiceOfEntity("{entityName}")]`

These attribute are being used in the Incremental Generators code to identify which classes the developer wants to automatically create the code for.

For the auto generation of the Blazor pages, currently, the process is a little bit different.
You need to create a file "AutoGeneratePages.txt" in the location
"/Pages/{entityName}"

The file need to have all of each CRUD action you want to autogenerated
A CRUD action would be any of these
* Create
* List
* Edit
* Delete

**Note**: Currently, only the Create functionality is implemented

After you have created the file, change the file's Build Action to "C# analyzer additional file", and compile your application.
The generator will create the .razor and .razor.cs files for each of the CRUD actions specified in the text file.
The "BlazorPagesIncrementalGenerator" currently creates the files in the by writing them directly on disk, in order to avoid manually implementing 
all of the .razor autogeneration logic performed by Visual Studio, therefore, you may need to compile 1-2 times before debugging your application in order for the
autogenerated pages to work correctly.

## Current AutoGenerated methods
### ServicesIncrementalGenerator
* Create{entityName}Async
* GetAll{entityName}
* Delete{entityName}Async
* Update{entityName}Async
* Get{entityName}ByIdAsync

### ControllersIncrementalGenerator
* Create{entityName}
* GetAll{entityName}
* Delete{entityName}
* Update{entityName}
* Get{entityName}ById

## Limitations
* The "BlazorPagesIncrementalGenerator" class, which create the Blazor pages, will only create data-input fields for the following data types
  * bool?, bool
  * int?, int
  * long?, long
  * decimal?, decimal
  * double?, double
  * System.String?, System.String, string?, string
  * System.DateTimeOffset?, System.DateTimeOffset, System.DateTime?, System.DateTime

## Known Issues
If you hav any project with *EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles* set to True, the compilation may fail if you have the project located in a long path, to solve it remove the element or locate the project on the drive's root e.g. "C:\\"
