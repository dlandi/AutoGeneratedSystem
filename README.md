# AutoGeneratedSystem
A sample app using C# Incremental Source Generators
C# Source Generatos allow you to inspect and enrich your code while compiling.
In this specific sample, we are using Incremental Generators to generate the code for Services, API Endpoints, and API Clients.
You will see some partial classes decorated with attributes such as
* `[ServiceOfEntity("{entityName}")]`
* `[ControllerOfEntity("{entityName}")]`
* `[ClientServiceOfEntity("{entityName}")]`

These attribute are being used in the Incremental Generators code to identify which classes the developer wants to automatically create the code for.
